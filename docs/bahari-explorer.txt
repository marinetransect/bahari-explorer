Hardware:
- 4 stabilizer rotors (to prevent it from being eaten up by water current)
- Improved thrusters
- Main motherboard: Allwiner a10 processor/cpu, pmc female connector
- underwater RF electronics. RF for the ship and RF for the ROV and can we get video data across reliably.
- expansion board: pmc male connector. Telemetry Sensors:
	> stereo cameras: SONY TRV 900S
	> ppm
	> pH
	> oxygen content (dissolved oxygen content)
	> pressure	
	> orientation
	> depth
	> position
	> temperature
	> salinity
	> POM: Particulate Organic Matter
	> DOM: Dissolved Organic Matter
	> Turbidity
	> Conductivity (level of electrolytes in water)
	> Water current meter (water speed)
- Beacon

Software:
- Web portal:
	> interface to view all the telemetry data in real-time
	> interface to view video in realtime and store the video to attached storage. Stereo-imagery
	> add markers to data
	> perform analytics on data
	> generate reports
	> view ROV's position
	
- Firmware:
	> ARM Linux kernel
	> Linux drivers to control the various sensors
	> Linux drivers to control the rotors and monitor rotor/thrusters temperature
	> RF status stats: power levels etc
